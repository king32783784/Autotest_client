============================
Conmux - Console Multiplexor
============================

Conmux is a console multiplexor. It can:

-  Connect to a serial console or network console
-  Allow multiple users to connect to the console session at once, and
   share that session
-  Control power strips etc (via expect scripts) - these are abstracted
   through commands like "~$hardreset"

Manual usage:

``console <machinename>``
