Preconfigured Graphing Queries
==============================

It is possible to build a preconfigured query and keep it on the server.
These preconfigs will appear on the graphing interface under the
**Preconfigured** control. Preconfig files are key:value pairs separated
by lines that build the query on the frontend. See
[[MetricsPlot]] and [[MachineQualHistograms]].

The two frontends have different preconfig formats:

- [[MetricsPreconfigs]]
- [[QualPreconfigs]]
