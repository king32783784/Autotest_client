Who uses autotest?
==================

An active community of users is fundamental to sustain an open source project.
Currently, there are quite a few projects that use autotest as their main test
automation platform:

* Fedora's `AutoQA <https://fedorahosted.org/autoqa/>`_
* `Chrome OS <http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/testing/autotest-developer-faq>`_
* `KVM kernel based virtual machine <http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/KVM-Autotest>`_
* Goobuntu (internal customized version of ubuntu for google)

Besides these projects, other people from several different companies/affiliations
use autotest for their test automation needs.
